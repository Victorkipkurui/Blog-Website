I created a blog site using React for the front-end and Django for the back-end. React handles the user interface, making the site interactive and dynamic while Django serves as the back-end framework managing the database, routing and server-side logic. The combination of these technologies allows for a modern, responsive blog site where users can interact with content seamlessly.
